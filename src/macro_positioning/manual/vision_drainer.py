"""Pending-vision drainer — turns pending_vision=true documents into
extracted_features_json by calling analyze_manual_chart() on each
attachment, then clearing the flag.

Designed to be cheap to re-run (each pass picks up new pending rows) and
safe to interrupt — partial work is committed per-document. Intended to
run on a cron, on demand from the SPA, or as a background task on save.

Usage:
    from macro_positioning.manual.vision_drainer import drain
    summary = drain()                # process all pending
    summary = drain(limit=10)        # batch
    summary = drain(document_id="x") # single doc
