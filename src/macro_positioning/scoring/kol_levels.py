"""Trusted-voice levels — what the humans drew, weighted by who was right.

The chart structure in `prices.structure` says where the levels are. This
module says which of them people the operator actually follows have called
out, and how much that should count.

Three weights multiply into one:

- **Track record** — `learning.call_accuracy.source_accuracy` gives each
  author a backtested `setup_win_rate` (target hit before stop). Authors
  without enough priceable calls to be `meaningful` still contribute, but
  at a floor weight: they can join a consensus, never drive one.
- **Recency** — a level drawn six weeks ago on a chart that has since
  moved is not the level being defended today. Half-life in days.
- **Conviction** — the extractor's 0–5 read on how hard the call was
  stated, normalised with a floor so a quiet mention still counts.

Only authors on the seeded allowlist are considered at all — the same rule
the conviction map uses. A channel the listener happened to pick up is not
a trusted voice just because it posted a number.

Every consensus carries its contributors, so the card can say *who* called
the level and *why* it counts, rather than presenting a number from
nowhere.
