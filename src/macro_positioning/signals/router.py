Rule of thumb:
  - Docs whose source already encodes direction + ticker + size in
    structured fields (the insiders package: house, senate, form4,
    13d/g, 13f, usaspending, lda) → rule-based `insider_extractor`.
    No LLM needed — it's deterministic and free.
  - Everything else (manual prose drops, news articles, blogs) →
    `llm_extractor` for prose extraction with Gemini/Claude.

A document can flow through multiple extractors — e.g. a manual chat
drop that the user typed prose into AND attached structured metadata
to. Each extractor's output is persisted as its own Signal rows.
